### How is this different from `gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths`?

This plugin attempts to address the inability to client-side render singular
routes in Gatsby, most particularly with top level routes such as `/preview`.

With `gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths`, you must create at least 1 route that
is _still_ run through Gatsby's SSR pipeline that will handle the
client-side-routing. This can be problematic when you want top level client
routes like `https://hostname.com/preview` for client-side previews that are
heavily reliant on browser specific accessors like `window`.

This plugin establishes a `<Router>` behind the scenes of your index page that
will render your SSR'd index page or a client rendered page if the current path
matches what you specify in the `clientPaths` plugin options.

## Current Limitations

- Client rendered components that call the `useStaticQuery` hook will cause your
  app to crash.

## Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```
